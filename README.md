- Problem: From among the millions of customer browsing through a website all day, how do we predict which one is going to convert and add to our revenue?

- Model: Built a model to classify customers as Revenue generating v/s non-revenue generating using their online shoppping behavuior data over a year.
- Business Use Case: The simple model can be used by the business to coduct better targeted marketing campaigns than randomly sending out promotional mails.
- Dataset Discovery: The dataset is open-source, and it is available to the public on the website UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- EDA And Pre-processing: Used pearson correlation matrix to identify the numerical features that were highly correlated and merged them to ensure better model performance.
- Model Building: Decision Tree(post-pruning), randomForest, Boosted Trees, Neural Networks and Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated based on accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, ROC-auc.
